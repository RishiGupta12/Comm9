Serial communication manager (SCM)
-----------------------------------

![scm](images/scm.jpg "scm")

The 'serial communication manager (abbreviated as scm)' is an easy to use java library for communication over serial port. It supports RS-232 control signals handshaking, monitoring and has been ported to Linux, MAC, Solaris and Windows operating system. It is consistent, portable, efficient, reliable, testable, extensible, modifiable, scalable library.

It is powerfully configurable for both poll and event driven application designs be it low volume low frequency data or high volume high frequency data.

##Features
- Notification whenever a serial port is added/removed from system
- Linux, Windows, Mac OSX operating systems support
- ARM platform support (Embedded SE Java)
- Access to EIA232 standard DTR, CD, CTS, RTS and DSR signals
- Hardware and software flow-control options
- Custom baud rate setting support
- Both 32 and 64 bit library support
- Concurrent event driven non-blocking I/O
- Both poll based and listener based data read supported
- Find what all serial style ports are present in system 
- Extensive error detection and handling for reliable operations
- Functional, stress, stability, unit tested
- Fully documented both Java and C code
- Support for fault tolerant and recoverable application design
- Application specific parameters tuning for performance

##Getting started

The folder prebuilt contains ready-to-use jar file (scm-1.0.3.jar) that can be imported in any project and referenced right away.

```java
package example;
import com.embeddedunveiled.serial.SerialComManager;
import com.embeddedunveiled.serial.SerialComManager.BAUDRATE;
import com.embeddedunveiled.serial.SerialComManager.DATABITS;
import com.embeddedunveiled.serial.SerialComManager.FLOWCONTROL;
import com.embeddedunveiled.serial.SerialComManager.PARITY;
import com.embeddedunveiled.serial.SerialComManager.STOPBITS;

public class Example {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		try {
			SerialComManager scm = new SerialComManager();
			
			long handle = scm.openComPort("/dev/ttyUSB1", true, true, false);
			scm.configureComPortData(handle, DATABITS.DB_8, STOPBITS.SB_1, PARITY.P_NONE, BAUDRATE.B115200, 0);
			scm.configureComPortControl(handle, FLOWCONTROL.NONE, 'x', 'x', false, false);
			scm.writeString(handle, "testing hello", 0) == true);
			String data = scm.readString(handle);
			System.out.println("data read is :" + data);
			scm.closeComPort(handle);
		} catch (Exception e) {
			e.printStackTrace();
		}
	}
}
```
